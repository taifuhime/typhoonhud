# typhoonhud

A hud I threw together since I liked and disliked certain characteristics of others.
Some stuff is probably really terrible and doesn't work well, I have no experience with stuff like this and didn't try to make it work outside of my specs.

This is NOT a comprehensive HUD, it's only intended for Surf, Bhop, and Trikz gameplay.

currently heavily uses elements from:

[lodyb's surface hud](https://github.com/lodyb/surface) [chat and panel themes, recolored to suit my tastes ;3]

[INsanes DoDs GUI+HUD V11](http://www.dodbits.com/dods/index.php/downloads/download/11-dods-gui-and-huds/177-insanes-dods-gui-hud-v11-steampipe) [various inspirations and little pieces]

[INsanes CSS GUI+HUD V9](http://www.dodbits.com/dods/index.php/downloads/download/3-subcategory-example/178-insanes-css-gui-and-hud-ver-9-steampipe) [various inspirations and little pieces]
