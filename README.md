# typhoonhud


A hud I threw together since I liked and disliked certain characteristics of others.
Some stuff is probably really terrible and doesn't work well, I have no experience with stuff like this and didn't try to make it work outside of my specs.


currently heavily uses elements from:
lodyb's surface hud: https://github.com/lodyb/surface [chat and panel themes, recolored to suit my tastes ;3]
INsanes DoDs GUI+HUD V11 and CSS GUI+HUD V9: http://www.dodbits.com/dods/index.php/downloads/download/11-dods-gui-and-huds/177-insanes-dods-gui-hud-v11-steampipe and http://www.dodbits.com/dods/index.php/downloads/download/3-subcategory-example/178-insanes-css-gui-and-hud-ver-9-steampipe [various inspirations and little pieces]
